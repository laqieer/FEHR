-FE7, FE8: Integrated Escape Point Helper macros EscapePointPointerTable and NPCEscapePointPOinterTable. Declare escape point with EscapePoint(XX,YY,exit_direction) and EscapePointEnd. Change location of the table by redefining EscapePointTableOffset and NPCEscapePointTableOffset (shouldn't be nexessary to repoint the table).
-FE7: Changed music definitions to have proper capitalization ("Livestaff_map"->"LiveStaff_map"). Also added localized names. ("LiveStaff_map"->"HealStaff_map")
